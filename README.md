# special-relativity-sim
A Godot 3.5.3 simulation with two objects and the relativistic effects of near light-speed velocities to an observer.

The simulation includes:

* 2 interactable objects;
* Relativistic beaming effect simulation;
* Proper time calculation and visualization;
* Changeable light speed;
* Wave simulation;
* Doppler Effect phenomena;
* Total momentum visualization.
